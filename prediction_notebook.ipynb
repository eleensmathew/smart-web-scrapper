exploit network structure amazon product start constructing product network using data, network, set node ie, product set edge edge two product represents existence common reviewer figure show network

structure likely hold across application fake review found generally case set reviewer used rating manipulator likely substantially smaller general population reviewers, leading pattern unusual clustering observed network moreover, since show ground truth data necessary identify clusters, platform easily implement approach insight may also contribute study similar problems, botnet directed ad fraud online review assessment interestingly, result complement existing method used platform mitigate rating manipulation particular, platform often cautious new user review rather experienced reviewer many review approach probably correct general supported prior research result suggest exist set experienced reviewer posting many fake reviews, employing network structure platform detect finally, provide method detect product buy fake reviews, address question information amazon target products, sellers, reviewers, example, remove product reviews, remove product platform, ban seller selling platform, ban sue fake reviewer although amazon currently target writer fake reviews, view, amazon target seller approach would ban seller however, case false positive rate non zero quite costly furthermore, could provide perverse incentive seller buy fake review competitor try get banned therefore, likely balanced still effective strategy would punish seller reducing visibility marketplace eg, increasing search rank suspected buying fake reviews, would offset eliminate financial incentive generally, result show product network structure provides robust source information
