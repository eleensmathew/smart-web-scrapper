one period another, namely jaccard network similarity index ranging depending aggregation period defining link several author reported asymmetry degree within unsecured interbank lending network notably, craig von peter anand et al observe bank germany general fewer lender borrower le coz et al observe symmetrical pattern case repo exposure among largest bank eurozone several approach modeling interbank unsecured market proposed influential article poole introduces model interbank lending network absorbs randomly generated payment shocks, reserve requirement constraint seminal work followed numerous proposal network modeling interbank market recently, heider et al included counterparty risk lending network generated endogenous liquidity hoarding bech monnet considered search

netherlands use central bank funding hold excess reserve peripheral bank eg, spain italy borrow massively central bank fulfill need however, funding obtained end within core bank due payment imbalance reproduce behavior, reverse causality abm, flow payment shock move deposit peripheral core banks, generating liquidity need first ones, excess liquidity others see section ii recently, decline unsecured market led several author build equilibrium model explaining substitution effect secured unsecured interbank market however, modeling proposal describe equilibrium state interbank market author proposed dynamic model unsecured interbank market particular, blasques et al assume profit maximization risk monitoring cost generate sparse core periphery structure stable bilateral trading relationship lux obtain result using reinforcement learning scheme liu et al proposed abm interbank network lead endogenous formation financial network using data individual bank within abm model macroeconomics, several framework include multiple bank agent firm borrow, although allow interaction among bank modeling static interbank lending market found macroeconomic model overall, approach focus unsecured markets, largely replaced secured market moreover, model assume absence endogenous money creation process induces non centered shock requiring specific modeling finally, framework account reserve constraint introduction lcr significantly modified money market see section consider money market formed bank agents, representative economic agent, central bank bank create money lending economic agent latter reallocates deposit among bank agents, thus generating payment shock shock absorbed banking system thanks central bank funding repos assume existence single type fungible security usable collateral repo market, typically government bond bank agent must respect time reserves, lcr, leverage regulatory requirement none fixed income instrument system offer coupon bank characterized following accounting items, expressed monetary units, time step unit day cash either deposit central bank reserves, denoted security usable collateral, denoted security encumbered context repo, denoted loan economic agent denoted reverse repos granted banks, denotes sum open repo exposure time received bank bank fund equity, deposits, repo exposure received banks, central bank funding, denoted balance sheet collateral received context reverse repo, denoted collateral used context repo, denoted financial contract model either infinite maturity maturity repos evergreen ie unlimited maturity one month notice period cancellation therefore, bank must create new repos remediate immediate liquidity need unwinding existing reverse repos would provide liquidity late bank excess cash, would also wait day unwind existing repo, could immediately earn repo rate entering new reverse repo loans, central bank funding, security unlimited maturity deposit cash maturity mentioned above, assume none financial instrument offer coupon indeed, simulating yield dynamic necessary reproduce excess liquidity, repo use, network topology stylized fact fact, yield financial contract incorporated within bank behavioral rule prefer holding instrument delivering highest coupon requires defining relative static yield financial contract hence, model, security used collateral deliver higher interest rate discount facility rate remunerating bank cash balance assumption consistent empirical observation example, eurozone, year german government bond almost systematically delivered higher coupon ecb discount facility rate addition, rate central bank funding higher repo rate, therefore bank incentive borrow central bank repo market rate higher discount rate, bank accept entering reverse repo excess cash finally, assume loan rate real economy highest rate available bank agent bank subject three regulatory obligation minimum reserve constraint bank must keep share deposit receive form central bank reserves, ie, lcr constraint, requiring bank maintain ratio unencumbered asset cash outflow next day one within model balance sheet banks, lcr constraint amount assuming regulatory net deposit outflow security received context repo remain unencumbered one month stress test following sections, refer effective defined liquidity ratio lcr ratio bank mean bank face outflow rate deposit must higher regulatory leverage ratio solvency ratio constraint, requiring bank keep fund certain share total asset worth mentioning leverage ratio play role solvency ratio, requires bank maintain minimum level fund solvency ratio complex account involves risk measurement also less binding leverage constraint low risk activity thus, choose ignore solvency ratio constraint model financial instrument model created endogenously bank create amount new money step lending cash representative economic agent latter must store amount form deposit bank ensure money creation process compatible three regulatory constraints, value newly created security fund must proportional new loan security typically government bond issued representative economic agent bought banking

money creation thanks multiplicative random growth process shock fluctuate around average rate new money let log normal random variable volatility independent across bank step amount created money given growth rate money neither process normalized version converge towards stationary distribution however, report appendix normalized size bank behaves non stationary log normal distribution evolves slowly compared typical time scale model notably, tail log normal distribution remains stable within given range, sufficiently long time around step network reach state close stationarity see section iii feasible design random growth model generates stationary limit using approach proposed marsili et al gabaix bouchaud zard indeed, model either require defining negative drift facilitating cash exchange bank see appendix empirical literature, consensus regarding size distribution bank author suggest distribution follows power law tail exponent zipf law across time region however, goddard et al argue bank size better described truncated log normal distribution differentiating power law log normal distribution challenging small sample size context banks, thousand financial institution within given monetary zone, limit ability accurately assess size distribution model, long bank size sufficiently heterogeneous, observe specific distribution bank size log normal power law influence stylized fact previously mentioned hence, order reach faster stationarity, conduct parameter space see section iii stress test analysis see section iii initializing money creation power law tail

shock modify balance sheet bank lead breach regulatory constraint case, central bank funding repo market used bank agent meet obligation enhance readability section, assume inequality characterizing regulatory constraint bank agent equality money creation payment shocks, ie fact, model structurally generates excess liquidity ie excess lcr ie asymmetric response bank payment shocks, described beginning step bank receives money creation shock payment shock meet three regulatory constraints, bank act follows lcr management secured lending keep lcr level unchanged see section hence, absence unsecured market, bank optimize lcr level central bank funding denote amount central bank funding bank request end maintain lcr level bank must minimize central bank funding assume share security created money creation process equal regulatory lcr level new optimal funding given hence, negative payment shock lead bank request central funding contrast, positive shock lead reduction central bank funding excess lcr overall, net sum central bank funding positive, introduces excess liquidity system reserve management bank use repos optimize central bank reserve one month notice period contract requires bank open new long short position manage short term liquidity bank close existing repos meet leverage ratio obligation see next paragraph denote amount repo requested bank reverse repo bank willing accept order maintain lcr target level bank must minimize repo exposure new bank excess reserve shocks, also assume absence excess lcr, ie previous equation becomes banking regulation typically set difference positive neglect money creation shock ie clear receiving negative payment shock implies requesting repos contrast, positive shock lead bank willing enter reverse repo nevertheless, possible bank hold sufficient collateral enter repo, case, request additional central bank funding leverage management management reserve opening repos reverse repos inflates bank balance sheet current leverage ratio bank becomes lower targeted level start ending existing repos positive shock contrary lcr reserve constraints, bank immediate solution available reduce size balance sheet hence choose target leverage ratio greater regulatory requirement, consequence, bank start closing existing repos risking breach minimum leverage ratio assume repos initiated ended borrower cash bank ready participate repo market individual management lcr market clearing performed follow bank end existing repos one one shuffled order bank start contacting counterpart lowest trust level whose dynamic described lender cash sufficient collateral end reverse repo, bank must end repos assume lender cash receives cash back slightly providing back collateral cash borrower mechanism ensures lender cash owns enough cash close existing repos get back used collateral situation trigger cascade collateral call back detailed then, bank enter repos one one another reshuffled order time, bank start contacting counterpart highest trust factor latter accept entering reverse repo excess cash, ie naturally, bank engage simultaneously repos reverse repos however, lead collateral loop security loaned one bank loaned original lender cases, model, sequential call collateral unwind existing repos might converge prohibiting collateral loop would lead rapid collapse money market high density repo network therefore, model permit loops, even though mean simulation may run completion actual markets, two counterparties within collateral loop want unwind positions,
